    "Apache Thrift is an open-source framework for developing cross-language services and applications. It enables communication between systems that use different programming languages by providing a way to define data types and service interfaces in a simple, compact language. Thrift then generates the necessary code for a wide range of programming languages, allowing for seamless communication between systems that otherwise wouldn't be able to understand each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of Apache Thrift as a translator that helps different systems (written in different programming languages) communicate with each other.\n",
    "Just like a translator would take a message in one language and convert it into another language, Apache Thrift helps different parts of a system \"talk\" to each other by converting data structures and method calls from one programming language to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main components of Apache Thrift:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interface Definition Language (IDL)**: Thrift uses its own IDL to define data types and services. You describe your data structures and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service methods using this language. For example, you can define complex data structures (like structs and enums) and service operations that can be called remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Generation**: After defining the data types and services in Thrift IDL, the framework generates source code in multiple languages (such as Java, C++, Python, Go, etc.). This code includes the data structures, serialization, and service handling mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Serialization/Deserialization**: Thrift allows for efficient binary serialization and deserialization of data, making it suitable for high-performance applications, especially when transferring large amounts of data across networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cross-Language Communication**: Thrift supports many programming languages, and each Thrift-generated library includes a transport layer, which handles sending and receiving data across the network. This allows systems written in different languages to communicate easily with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**: It provides an RPC framework that allows clients to call functions on a remote server as if they were local, with the underlying complexity of network communication abstracted away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Building microservices that communicate across different languages.\n",
    "* Creating high-performance, cross-platform systems where different components are written in different languages.\n",
    "* Efficient communication in distributed systems, especially in environments where high scalability and performance are critical.\n"
   ]

    "\n",
    "### How it works, step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a common language (IDL)**: You describe the data structures and services in **Thrift's Interface Definition Language (IDL)**. This is like creating a \"universal dictionary\" that all systems can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate the translation code**: Thrift generates code in multiple programming languages (like Python, Java, C++, etc.) from your IDL. This code includes the data structures, methods, and serialization/deserialization logic needed to translate between languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Server (Speaker 1)**: On the server side, you implement the actual service methods, using the Thrift-generated code. The server will \"speak\" its own language (e.g., Python) but use Thrift to translate the messages from other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Client (Speaker 2)**: On the client side, you use Thrift-generated code to call the server's methods, and Thrift handles the translation. The client might be in a different language (e.g., Java), but Thrift allows it to communicate with the server by \"translating\" the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have a **Python** server that needs to accept requests from a **Java** client.\n",
    "* You define the data structures (like `User` objects) and methods (like `getUserDetails()`) in Thrift's IDL.\n",
    "* Thrift generates the necessary Python and Java code to **serialize** the `User` data and **make remote calls** between the two languages.\n",
    "* When the Java client sends a request to the Python server, Thrift handles the **translation** of the method call and data between the two languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this case, Thrift acts as the \"translator\" that allows the client and server to understand each other, even if they speak different programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this help clarify the \"translator\" analogy? Would you like an example of how to use Thrift to set up a simple server-client communication?\n"

    "The thrift type system includes base types like _bool, byte, double, string and integer_ but also special types like _binary_ and _struct_ (like classes) and also containers (_list, set, map_) that correspond to commonly available interfaces in most programming languages.\n",

    "### Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the following example record (JSON or dictionary-like) to encode:\n",

    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"userName\": \"Martin\",\n",
    "  \"favoriteNumber\": 1337,\n",
    "  \"interests\": [\"daydreaming\", \"hacking\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can encode the record in Thrift using the following schema in the `.thrift` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```thrift\n",
    "struct Person {\n",
    "  1: required string userName,\n",
    "  2: optional i64 favoriteNumber,\n",
    "  3: optional list<string> interests\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thrift comes with a code generation tool that takes a schema definition like the ones shown here, and produces classes that implement the schema in various programming languages. Our code can call this generated code to encode or decode records of the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data encoded with this schema looks like this:\n",
    "![thrift_binary_protocol](../assets/thrift_binary_protocol.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each field has a type annotation (to indicate whether it is a string, integer, list, etc.) and, where required, a length indication (length of a string, number of items in a list). The strings that appear in the data (“Martin”, “daydreaming”, “hacking”) are encoded as UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no field names (userName, favoriteNumber, interests). Instead, the encoded data contains _field tags_, which are numbers (1, 2, and 3). Those are the numbers that appear in the schema definition. Field tags are like aliases for fields—they are a compact way of saying what field we’re talking about, without having to spell out the field name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's add a service. A service is a collection of method interfaces that can be called remotely. A service is defined in a `.thrift` file like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```thrift\n",
    "service School {\n",
    "    Person teachCourse(1: required Person person, 2: required string course)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line declares a service called `School`. The second line declares a method called `teachCourses`, which takes two arguments: a `Person` record and a `string`. The method returns a `Person` record.\n",

    "### RPC - Remote Procedure Call\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote Procedure Call - Calling a function on another computer as if it were a local function. The function will actually runs on the another machine and not your own.\n",
