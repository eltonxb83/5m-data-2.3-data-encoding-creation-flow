    "\n",
    "* Much **faster**\n",
    "* **Smaller** in size\n",
    "* Strongly typed\n",
    "\n",
    "They are widely used in **network communications, microservices, or storing data** where efficiency matters.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Protobuf involves **three main steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define your data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "You create a `.proto` file describing your data schema. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```proto\n",
    "syntax = \"proto3\";\n",
    "\n",
    "message Person {\n",
    "  int32 id = 1;\n",
    "  string name = 2;\n",
    "  string email = 3;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `message` is like a class or struct.\n",
    "* Each field has a **type**, a **name**, and a **unique tag number** (used in the binary encoding).\n",
    "* `syntax = \"proto3\";` specifies the version of Protobuf.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Compile the schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the **Protobuf compiler** (`protoc`) to generate code for your programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "protoc --python_out=. person.proto\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This generates a Python class `Person` that you can use to **serialize/deserialize** objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Serialize and deserialize data\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from person_pb2 import Person\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new person\n",
    "p = Person()\n",
    "p.id = 1\n",
    "p.name = \"Elton\"\n",
    "p.email = \"elton@example.com\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Serialize to binary\n",
    "data = p.SerializeToString()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deserialize\n",
    "p2 = Person()\n",
    "p2.ParseFromString(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SerializeToString()` → converts the object into a **compact binary format**.\n",
    "* `ParseFromString()` → converts binary back to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fields and Tags**: Each field in a message has a unique tag number. This is used in the binary format, not the field name.\n",
    "2. **Optional/Repeated fields**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `repeated` → like a list/array.\n",
    "   * Fields can be optional; missing fields just get default values.\n",
    "3. **Nested messages**: Messages can contain other messages.\n",
    "4. **Backward/forward compatibility**: You can add/remove fields without breaking old code, as long as you don’t reuse tag numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compact: smaller than JSON/XML.\n",
    "* Fast: binary encoding is optimized.\n",
    "* Cross-platform: supports many languages (Python, Java, Go, C++, JavaScript, etc.)\n",
    "* Version-tolerant: easy to evolve data schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ When to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "* Microservices communication (gRPC uses Protobuf by default)\n",
    "* Mobile apps communicating with a server\n",
    "* Storing large datasets in a compact format\n",
    "* Any high-performance network application\n",

    "As depicted in the figure, a repeated field is simply represented by the same field tag appearing multiple times in the record. The advantage of this approach is that converting an optional (single-valued) field into a repeated (multi-valued) field is permissible. When new code reads old data, it interprets it as a list with either zero or one element, depending on whether the field was present. On the other hand, old code reading new data only perceives the last element of the list.\n",

    "### 2️⃣ What’s Different\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `.proto` vs `.thrift`\n",
    "   * Protobuf uses `message` and `service`; Thrift uses `struct` and `service`.\n",
    "2. **Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * gRPC (Protobuf) uses stubs for client/server.\n",
    "   * Thrift has its own **transport + protocol layers** and can run over TCP, HTTP, etc.\n",
    "3. **Optional Fields**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `proto3` has default handling and optional flags.\n",
    "   * Thrift has `optional`, `required`, and `default` values.\n",
    "4. **Language Support & Ecosystem**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Both support multiple languages, but gRPC + Protobuf has stronger adoption in cloud/microservices.\n",
    "5. **Streaming**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * gRPC supports **streaming RPCs** natively.\n",
    "   * Thrift also supports some streaming patterns, but more manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Example Flow in Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define `Person` and `CourseRequest`** → `.proto` (like Thrift `.thrift`)\n",
    "2. **Compile** → generates `person_pb2.py` + `person_pb2_grpc.py` (like Thrift-generated code)\n",
    "3. **Server**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Implements `teachCourse` → modifies `Person` object (like Thrift service implementation)\n",
    "4. **Client**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Creates a stub and calls `teachCourse` → gets returned `Person` object (like Thrift client)\n",
    "\n",
    "> So yes, the **conceptual architecture is identical**, only the **code style, tooling, and protocols** differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can draw a **side-by-side diagram showing Protobuf/gRPC vs Thrift flow**—it makes it extremely easy to visualize the similarity and differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want me to do that?\n"

Then call the method by passing \"Martin\" `person` and a grade number, and print his grade."
